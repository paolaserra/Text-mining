# Hormones receptors status in breast cancer

The project aims at enforcing classification algorithms in order to predict hormones receptors status in breast cancer. 
Learning whether a tumor has particular proteins helps doctors determine a personâ€™s risk of recurrence. 
Focusing on two main hormones, estrogen and progesterone, a Multioutput-multiclass classification approach was used and on human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 a multiclass classification was implemented
